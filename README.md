# 🎮 Horror Game – Core Systems (Unreal Engine 5)

This repository contains core gameplay mechanics developed for my first-person horror game in Unreal Engine 5.

## 🧩 Implemented Systems

- 🎮 **Character Logic**: movement, crouch, interaction base, input system
- 📄 **Note System**: documents, notes, photos — with readable UI and storage
- 🎒 **Inventory System**: simple inventory with item interaction
- 💾 **Save System**: saving/loading player progress, inventory, and state
- ⚙️ **Event System**: modular events triggered by player or game state
- 🔧 **Settings System**: in-game settings menu (audio, video, controls)
- 🧬 **Attribute System**: basic stats like health, stamina, sanity, etc.
- 👐 **Interaction System**: raycast-based interaction with world objects

## 🧠 Purpose

These systems were developed as reusable, scalable building blocks for a narrative-driven psychological horror experience.

## 📌 Note

Blueprint + C++ implementation. Designed with modularity and clean structure in mind.
